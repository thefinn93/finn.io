I've just picked up [finn.io](https://finn.io), and I decided it was time to redo my website. The old one looks hideous, and was all in PHP. This is a static site, generated with Jekyll (still playing with it, I think I like it though) then managed through git. I'm not sure where I want this site (and this domain) to be for yet, but I'm finding out. Starting with this blog post.
